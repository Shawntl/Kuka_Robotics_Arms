# CS7180project
The main contribution of this project is a demonstration of asynchronous advantage actor-critic, NAF, DDPG algorithms performance on robotic arms manipulation tasks. Our technical contribution consists of build a static, dynamic environment for the experiment, algorithm implementation, optimize both environment and neural net by doing feature engineering and reward engineering. Our experiments also evaluate the benefits of deep neural network representations for several manipulation tasks, including scratch fixed objects, scratch moving objects, move it to right place.
